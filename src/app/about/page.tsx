        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-4">
          vidd was born out of a tiny, very real frustration: I wanted to watch
          a movie on my TV from a USB stick — simple, right? Nope. The TV gave
          my MKV file the cold shoulder. It refused to play my cherished file,
          so I had to re-download the movie as an MP4. Such a waste of time. 😩
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-4">
          I went looking for tools online and stumbled upon <code>ffmpeg</code>,
          the swiss-army knife of video. It could convert the file in the CLI —
          but honestly, the command line felt like decoding ancient hieroglyphs.
          Tools existed, but I wanted something that fit my workflow: a browser
          friendly, local (privacy-first) converter with a friendly UI. And so
          vidd was born.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-4">
          This project was primarily a way for me to learn FFmpeg and solve the
          universal problem of unsupported file formats. I love building my own
          software, and with a pinch of AI and a sprinkle of JavaScript, ideas
          come to life. 🚀
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-4">
          If you like tinkering, improving UX, or making conversion pipelines
          faster and friendlier, vidd is open source and welcomes contributions.
          Whether its improving the UI, optimizing FFmpeg flags, or adding
          more formats — all help is appreciated. ❤️

# vidmage-converter

Easily convert any video or image to whatever format using ffmpeg on the web

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## About vidd üéûÔ∏èüî•

vidd started as a tiny revenge plan against annoying file formats and as a way to learn FFmpeg.

- The story: I wanted to watch a movie on my TV from a USB stick. My file was an MKV and the TV gave it the cold shoulder ‚Äî it wouldnt play it. I had to re-download the movie as an MP4. Such a waste of time. üò©
- I found out about `ffmpeg` ‚Äî it can convert anything ‚Äî but the CLI felt like a labyrinth of flags and despair. Tools existed, but I wanted something friendly, privacy-first (runs locally), and built by me.
- So I built vidd: a browser-facing frontend that uses FFmpeg to convert videos and images, learn-by-building style. üöÄ

I love building my own software. With a little help from AI and JavaScript, an idea turned into this project. If you want to help make vidd better ‚Äî whether its improving UI, adding formats, or optimizing FFmpeg flags ‚Äî contributions are very welcome. ‚ù§Ô∏è

This project is open source. Pull requests, issues, and good ideas are appreciated.

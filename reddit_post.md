Title: I built "vidd" a browser-based FFmpeg converter after my TV rejected my MKV (open source, for those looking to contribute)

Hey anyone! ðŸ‘‹

 I built a tiny tool called **vidd**(i know the names lame) to convert videos/images in the browser using FFmpeg, mostly because of a very relatable pain point.

My story :-
- I plugged a USB into my TV to watch a movie. The file was an MKV. The TV said "nope." So I re-downloaded the movie as an MP4. Waste of time? Absolutely. ðŸ˜©
- I looked for solutions and discovered `ffmpeg`, a powerful command-line tool that can convert practically anything. But the CLI felt like a cryptic puzzle and I wanted something more approachable.
- I wanted a local, browser friendly, privacy-first UI to do the job. So I learned a lot about FFmpeg, JavaScript, and web tooling, and built vidd.

What it does:
- Convert videos & images to GIF and other formats(all the current formats where added in response to my needs, so maybe you can do the same ðŸ˜Š), runs in the browser/local environment.
- No upload required and processing happens locally for privacy.

Want to help?
- I am still learning how to code so vidd is open source. If you're into UI improvements, FFmpeg optimization, or adding format support, I'd love your help.

Thanks for reading, and if youve ever felt personally victimised by your TVs file format support, youre not alone. ðŸ˜‚

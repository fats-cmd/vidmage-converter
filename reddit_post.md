Title: I built "vidd" a browser-based FFmpeg converter after my TV rejected my MKV (open source, for those looking toi contribute)

Hey everyone! 👋

Short and sweet: I built a tiny tool called **vidd** to convert videos/images in the browser using FFmpeg, mostly because of a very relatable pain point.

My story :-
- I plugged a USB into my TV to watch a movie. The file was an MKV. The TV said "nope." So I re-downloaded the movie as an MP4. Waste of time? Absolutely. 😩
- I looked for solutions and discovered `ffmpeg` — a powerful command-line tool that can convert practically anything. But the CLI felt like a cryptic puzzle and I wanted something more approachable.
- I wanted a local, browser friendly, privacy-first UI to do the job. So I learned a lot about FFmpeg, JavaScript, and web tooling, and built vidd.

What it does:
- Convert videos & images to GIF and other formats(all the current formats where added in response to my needs, so maybe you can do the same 😊), runs in the browser/local environment.
- No upload required — processing happens locally for privacy.

Want to help?
- vidd is open source. If you're into UI improvements, FFmpeg optimization, or adding format support, I'd love your help.

Thanks for reading — and if youve ever felt personally victimised by your TVs file format support, youre not alone. 😂

Cheers,
